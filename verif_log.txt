ERROR_LOG: (node:16072) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///C:/Users/amaan/Desktop/New%20folder/AK/services/aiService.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.

To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to C:\Users\amaan\Desktop\New folder\AK\package.json.

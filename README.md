## PROBLEM STATEMENT 

### What does a consumer health experience look like when AI is the interface, not a feature ?
The Consumer Health Information Gap Food labels are optimized for regulatory compliance, not human understanding.
Consumers are expected to interpret:
   - Long ingredient lists
   - Unfamiliar chemical names
   - Conflicting or evolving health guidance
____________________________________________________________________________________________________

## BRIEF EXPLANATION OF THE PROBLEM STATEMENT 

Consumers struggle to make informed health decisions because food labels are designed for regulatory compliance rather than human understanding. Interpreting long ingredient lists, unfamiliar chemical names, and constantly changing health guidelines requires expertise that most consumers do not have. This information gap leads to confusion, poor dietary choices, and reduced trust in food products.

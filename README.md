## PROBLEM STATEMENT 

### What does a consumer health experience look like when AI is the interface, not a feature ?
The Consumer Health Information Gap Food labels are optimized for regulatory compliance, not human understanding.
Consumers are expected to interpret:
   - Long ingredient lists
   - Unfamiliar chemical names
   - Conflicting or evolving health guidance
____________________________________________________________________________________________________

## BRIEF EXPLANATION OF THE PROBLEM STATEMENT 

Consumers struggle to make informed health decisions because food labels are designed for regulatory compliance rather than human understanding. Interpreting long ingredient lists, unfamiliar chemical names, and constantly changing health guidelines requires expertise that most consumers do not have. This information gap leads to confusion, poor dietary choices, and reduced trust in food products.

## PROPOSED SOLUTION

### Instant Product Understanding
Users scan a product’s barcode, and the app instantly fetches ingredient details from an external source—no manual searching or label reading required.

### Context-Aware AI Reasoning
The app analyzes ingredients using AI while considering personal factors like dietary preferences or allergies. This allows the system to understand ingredients in context, rather than relying on fixed rules.

### Clear, Simple Decisions
Instead of raw data, the app provides a straightforward verdict:
  - YES – Safe and suitable
  - NO – Not recommended
  - MODERATE – Acceptable with caution

Each result includes a short explanation so users understand why the decision was made.

### Transparent Explanations
For users who want more detail, the “Know More” option explains the reasoning behind the verdict, building trust and clarity.

### Technical Approach

The frontend is built using Expo and JavaScript for fast development and cross-platform support.
The app avoids a traditional backend and uses lightweight, API-based interactions to stay simple and responsive.
AI-driven reasoning allows the system to scale easily as new products, ingredients, and user needs emerge.

### Impact

The app reduces mental effort, prevents decision fatigue, and helps users make confident food choices in seconds. By combining AI with real-world health needs, it delivers a practical, human-centered solution.
